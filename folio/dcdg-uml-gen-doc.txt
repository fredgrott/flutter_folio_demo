generally its

take the localization_gen out of lib/src/ folder and use

flutter pub global run dcdg    --output=reports/docs/diagrams/src/diagrams.puml

for mermaid its

flutter pub global run dcdg  -b mermaid --output=reports/docs/diagrams/out

to generate the puml file

Then we run an IDE plugin to convert that file to a png file


and then finally move localization_gen back to its original lib/src/ location.
