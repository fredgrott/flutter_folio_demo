LCOV Flutter Test Commands
-the exanded parameter is the setting used for CI-Servers(I use in non CI Server runs as well)

flutter test --coverage --reporter=expanded --coverage-path=./reports/coverage/lcov.info 

Then you run genhtml according to how your platform has the genhtml perl tool

for windows with LCOV installed under chocolately its:

perl C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\lcov\tools\bin\genhtml reports\coverage\lcov.info -o reports\coverage\html

generally for other platforms its:

$GENHTNL reports/coverage/lcov.info -o reports/coverage/html
