/// This notifier is meant to implement the [Listenable] our [GoRouter] needs.
///
/// We aim to trigger redirects whenever's needed.
/// This is done by calling our (only) listener everytime we want to notify stuff.
/// This allows to centralize global redirecting logic in this class.
/// In this simple case, we just listen to auth changes.
///
/// SIDE NOTE.
/// This might look overcomplicated at a first glance;
/// Instead, this method aims to follow some good some good practices:
///   1. It doesn't require us to pipe down any `ref` parameter
///   2. It works as a complete replacement for [ChangeNotifier] (it's a [Listenable] implementation)
///   3. It allows for listening to multiple providers if needed (we do have a [Ref] now!).
