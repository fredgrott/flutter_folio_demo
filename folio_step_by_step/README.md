# Folio Step By Step

Due to Google developing 3 front-ends the flutter SDK team is stretched to the breaking point which then means there a significant implementation holes that are patched fragemented wise by the Flutter Community.  

The best way to deal with that in a value-added way is to offer a step-by-step look into how a typical flutter app is designed and developed. Hence why all my demo apps for my app design books are structured this way.

Each major step has it's own folder with sub projects that break out that step and they are numbered so one can follow along.
