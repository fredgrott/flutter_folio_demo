Sequence

Because several things are directly coupled together I include some 
things beyond the traditional devops as it then becomes clear how 
they fit together in flutter app design and development processes. It's 
step by step so you can follow along.

My own bias in devops is that I do not use instrumented testing as the device 
preview added with proper goldens and widget testing is generally good enough
to cover every test case.

1. vscode_setup
2. lint_setup
3. logging_setup
4. other platform stuff
5. adaptive scaffold (and nav)
6 theme setup
8 state
10. app_exception_capture
11. test_setup (unit, goldens, instegrated, and yes BDD)
12. beg_arch_setup
