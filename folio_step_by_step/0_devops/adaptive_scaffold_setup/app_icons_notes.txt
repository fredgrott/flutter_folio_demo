raw image size is 1024x1024 as web and desktop have that as app icon size while mobile is smaller.
adaptive background size needs to be 432x432 (as xxxhdpi is 108*4 => 432x432)
adaptive foreground size needs to be 432x432 (as xxxhdpi is 108*4 => 432x432)
android size 1024x1024
ios 1024x1024
windows 1024x1024
macos 1024x1024
linux 1024x1024

**Use platform names in image files to separate those from the generated images
  as those will then be put in assets/images. Currently no support for linux
  but one can assume its just repurposing the windows launch image for now.


To generate the icons at the command line execute
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
